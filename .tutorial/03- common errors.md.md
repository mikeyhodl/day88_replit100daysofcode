The `script` code **must** be included in every page where you want a login function.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <script src="https://replit.com/public/js/repl-auth-v2.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Here's my site</h1>
    <p>Everyone can read this.</p>
 
    <button onclick="LoginWithReplit()"> Login </button>
  </body>
</html>
```
